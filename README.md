# CleanZone Platform

CleanZone Platform is a comprehensive web application designed to help individuals and teams manage projects focused on hygiene and cleanliness. It provides a user-friendly interface for collaboration, file sharing, and tracking progress on various cleaning and maintenance tasks. This platform aims to streamline communication and organization for community or workplace cleanliness initiatives.

## Features

The platform offers a modern, intuitive design built with the latest web technologies. It supports uploading different types of files to facilitate sharing relevant documents or media. The application is divided into frontend and backend components to ensure smooth performance and maintainability.

Users can expect:

- Interactive and responsive user interfaces that work seamlessly across devices.
- A modular codebase that makes future enhancements and debugging simpler.
- Easy-to-use file upload functionality for documents and images.
- Fast deployment and scalability using modern cloud hosting services.

## Project Structure

The project repository is organized into distinct directories to separate concerns clearly:

- The `backend` folder contains the server-side application, including API endpoints, database interactions, and business logic.
- The `frontend` folder holds all client-side code, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript files, and assets that run in the user's browser.

This structure ensures that both frontend and backend code can be developed and maintained independently while working together smoothly.
